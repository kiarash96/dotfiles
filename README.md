# Dotfiles
My linux configuration files are stored here.

## Usage
1. Edit `watchlist` as needed. You can add files or directories. If you add a directory all files in that directory will be backed up.
2. Once the configuration is done run `do-backup` script to copy listed files in `storage` directory.
3. Commit the changes and push.
